## Motivation
New York City has always had a rat problem. They live in our apartments, they ride the subway with us, they walk in our streets, and they’re showing up more and more. Rat sightings have increased 71% since October 2020, encouraging city officials to declare a “war on rats.” As the war continues, we wanted to see what the data said.
